            Check the script. JavaScript exhibits Prototypal Inheritance. In other 
            object oriented languages, class is an actual data type that represents 
            the blueprint for creating objects. In JavaScript, although we can use 
            Functions to simulate an object blueprint, they are just in fact objects 
            themselves. These objects are then used as models (aka prototypes) for 
            other objects.
            Applying the concept of prototypal inheritance allows us to create 
            "subclasses", or objects that inherit the properties of another object.
